                My name is Farah and I have been working on Gel Polish since the beginning of 2022! I live
                in
                The Hague with my family, where I completed my education in mid-2022. Before I started as a nail stylist
                I
                worked in the travel industry, but I missed some creativity in my work. Working as a nail
                technician is something I've always wanted to do. As a 9-year-old girl I already painted nails on the
                beaches of Curacao for some extra pocket money, when I lived there with my family. It has always stuck
                with me and I've been wanting to do more with this ever since.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-6">
                In the coming period I will follow extra training courses to obtain more certificates, so that I can
                perform my work as a nail stylist even better! At the moment I work on Mondays, Wednesdays and
                Fridays,
                from 09:00 to 17:30. I am super enthusiastic and enjoy my work very much!
